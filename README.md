<Semantic-Markup>

## Description

This markup was an exercise for my coding bootcamp to introduce us to semantic elements in HTML and CSS, and how to make webpages accessable to e-readers. The landing page itself is for an SEO company, and advertizes the features the company provides, such as search engine optimization, online reputation management, and social media marketing. In order to ensure accessability to the site, I included alt attributes to the images and made sure heading attributes were descriptive and fell in sequential order.
